   #. Press **Done**.

3. Set up your experimental run with the temperature
   probe appropriately positioned.

#. Press |image| to start recording the temperature. The display will
   change to a graph.

   .. note::
      On your second and subsequent runs, you will get a message about what
      to do with your previous run. Press **Discard**.

#. Allow the temperature to be recorded for about 15 s to be sure you
   have a flat baseline. Also, *record the initial temperature in your
   notebook*.

#. Perform a trial run.

#. After the temperature has leveled off for at least 20 s, record the
   final temperature, then press |image1| to stop recording.
